## Nature Recovery Indicators 

1. Area of woodland and green space 
2. SSSI Status 

## Nature Recovery: Evidence gaps

1. "..the abundance of wildlife has increased by 30% by 2030"
2. UK Pollinator Capital


* Indicators provide the conditions for these but don't measure the outcomes

* Online sources are sparse e.g. BRERC, iNaturalist

## Evidence - filling the data gaps

* Wildlife Index
* Define abundance and diversity metrics with ecologists
* Identify indicator species (pollinators + ...)
* Establish baseline and trajectory
* Species surveys to track progress (expensive)

## Community Citizen Science

* Citizens help collect Wildlife Index data
* Generate engagement, excitement and awareness
* Process must be easy, digital and rewarding for citizen

:::

## Project Outline

* Biodegradeable laser cut QR codes at key sites and walks
* Record priority species data: (count, species, timestamp, location)
* Promote - (EU) Pollinator Week, radio, schools
* Build on Round 1 Pollinator Fund projects
* Criterion for Round 2 funding?
* Scalable - can extend to e.g. fungi, mammals
* Supports formal surveys

## Technology

* Open data dashboard for transparency and reporting
* Link to iNaturalist, BRERC by REST API
* Track engagement with analytics
* Streamlit app to quickly prototype

## Summary

* A low - cost, engaging way to collect critical environmental data
* Scalable
* Quick to prototype and deploy
* Supports a key strategy commitment
